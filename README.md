# TackleTheDay

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.0.

## The point of this project

This project is meant for me to get back into the coding flow somewhat. This is a very basic angualr website that has minimum CSS, very basic CRUD operations and that's about it, but I wanted get understanding of how to use these in Angular and I feel like I was able to acheive this. I have a lot I would want to improve with this website, but I would rather leave this as is, so once I make a better website using Angular I can see what I have imporved on. But knowing I can make a website (Even if it is very basic) makes me excited to what I can do in the future. :)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
